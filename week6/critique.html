    <h1>Week 6 Coding Homework</h1>
    <h2>The Good</h2>
    <p>
        <li>
            The Webpage's colors match well with the Pacific Oceanside Vibe.
            Webpage is very easy to navigate it take minimal clicks to find the information I want.
            Links included to contact the Resort are kept in easy to find areas.
        </li>
    </p>
    <h2>The Bad</h2>
    <p>
        <li>
            The Fonts are boring and seemingly outdated and could have been contrasted better.
            More photos could have been provided to give the customer a better idea of the location and activies.
            Background should be changed because it looks like an old 2000's webpage.
        </li>
    </p>
    <h2>My Improvements</h2>
    <p>I would start of by focussing on updating the design of the webpage and modernizing it to open up to a younger crowd. I would provide an image or graphic after every segment so that any potential customer can get a good idea of the business. I would keep the coastal color palet but either replace or add more vibrant colors.</p>
